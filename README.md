     🧑🏻‍💻🎶
     I'm a artistic and dedicated Full-Stack Developer.
     </p>
    <p>Before programming, I went through a music career, which enabled me to explore and enrich my artistic and teaching skills.</p>
    <p>I've always felt driven by the need to create things. By learning to program I've been able to develop and empower that creative side of mine in a technological  environment. Creativity is now a must when it comes to solving a problem.</p>
    <p>Programming has also made me get back in touch with some "old" passions: English and logic. On the one hand, I took English classes since I was six, on the other hand, when I was in high school I participated in mathematical olympiads on several occasions.</p>
    <p>A perfect job would be one where I could draw upon my creative side in order to make great software.</p>
